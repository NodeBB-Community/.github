## What is the NodeBB Community Organization?

The NodeBB Community organization on GitHub manages a collection of third-party plugins that are considered under passive maintenance. This level of maintenance means that the plugin is no longer in active development, although bug fixes and pull requests are still accepted and reviewed.

Any additional functionality can be requested by emailing sales@nodebb.org directly.

## Why is *X* plugin in this org?

The plugin may be considered feature complete, or stable, or has been gifted to the NodeBB-Community org by the original plugin author. While they are no longer actively maintained by the core NodeBB team, plugins in this org should still work, and should be installable via npm.

Depending on the age of the plugin, they may not be in the ACP > Manage > Plugins list. If you install the plugin via npm and the plugin works as intended, feel free to open up an issue in that plugin's issue tracker, so they a developer can update the `nbbpm.compatibility` string.
